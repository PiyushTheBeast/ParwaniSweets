While making this ecommerce project i enjoyed and learned alot , and though i'm sad that this was the last thing i have to do in 
It lab i will for sure continue doing such projects and i will make this website much better and fully functional until then I thank 
Nagendra Sir and Satish Sir for all there teachings and all the youtubers who helped me with the project 

1.Index.php contains the main project [project wa made in visual code studio with apache and mysql in xampp]
2.Header.php and footer.php contains header and footer respectively 
3.DATABASE folder contains all the database based php files
4.product.php file contains product details of a the selected product
5.productlist.php contains all the products mentioned in database
6.Cart.php with cart-template and cart_not_found contains cart contents 

Database used sweets with tables:
1.product which contains id , product_name , image , price
2.cart which contains user id , id and cart_id
3.user contains user_id , firstname and lastname

All the HTML files present in the folder are my initial templates of how the website will look and function 

Though i'm quite familier with login and register forms i was unable to add them as i was caught into some problems with the code
so i removed them but i will perfect them and add them afterwards
Thankyou to whoever is reading
